# Note to myself
---
* I made this simultaneously with another project so i need to point and re-point my Apache between them. Here's the commands to re-point it.
```
  $ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
  $ sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
  $ sudo systemctl restart apache2
```
